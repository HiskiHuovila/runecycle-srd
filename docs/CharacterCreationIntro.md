## Aspects

### Select an Aspect
Select an Aspect that best embodies your PC. Your Aspect grants you all of its Combat Styles and some of its Runic Powers (see Runic Powers).

### Advanced Play
Advanced players can ignore the Aspect limitations and select Powers and Traits from any Aspect.

## Runic Powers
Select three Runic Powers that fit your Rune. Select at least one from your Aspect. Then select one Trait. Alternatively you may select 2 Traits as 1 Runic Power and you may do this multiple times.

### What are Runic Powers
Runic Powers are game mechanics that explain how you can use the magic of your Rune.

### What are Traits
Traits are weaker powers or features. A list of generic Traits can be found on page 46. Certain Runic Powers have subsections labeled as Trait. You may select these subsections as a Trait instead of the full Runic Power.

### Variants
Can’t find a specific Runic Power you want? You can easily create a variant power from the existing powers. For example, Control Lava can be a variant of Control Fire and Control Sand can be a variant of Control Earth and Stone.

## Weath & Items

### Select wealth

When selecting a starting wealth choose from the following:
Penniless: 1d6 Handfuls
Poor: 1 Bag = 5 Handfuls
Moderate: 1 Satchel = 4 Bags
Comfortable: 1 Chest = 3 Satchels
Wealthy: 2 Chests 

### What is wealth
PCs have money or valuables they use to sustain themselves. This is a narrative game, so the amount of wealth you carry is more of a narrative choice than a mechanical one. Wealth divides into four tiers: Handfuls, Bags, Satchels and Chests. Each Bag can contain 5 Handfuls of coins, each Satchel 4 Bags and each Chest 3 Satchels.

#### Other possessions 
Some PCs might own a horse, a house or a boat. If you PC has possession of items, vehicles, buildings and the like, write them down on a separate paper. Similarly to wealth this is a narrative choice. Your PC’s story might differ tremendously depending on what resources they have access to.

### What is Load?
One Load is equal to Item or Items that can be held in one hand or an approximate size equal to 1 liter. Two Load is equal to Item that can be held using two hands or an approximate size of 5 liters. You can count a malleable bag of 5 soft 1 Load Items as a bag of 2 Load.

### Backpack
Moving items to and from Backpack takes an Action. Your Backpack can carry up to 10 Load.

### Weapons and  Armor
