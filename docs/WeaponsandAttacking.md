## Close Combat
When you use the Attack Action in close combat you make an Attack roll. Take your Melee die and the die of the weapon specified below. The number of Successes you roll is dealt as damage to the target. Close Combat Attacks are done against creatures in Touch range.

| Improvised weapon | D6        |
| Unarmed           | Terra     |

## Ranged Combat
When you use the Attack Action to fire or throw a weapon you make an Attack roll. Take your Ranged die and the die of the weapon specified below. The number of Successes you roll is dealt as damage to the target. Ranged Combat weapons can be fired up to Distant.

| **Ranged Weapons**            | **Score** |
| ----------------------------- | --------- |
| Bow                           | Terra     |
| Crossbow                      | Moon      |
| Firearm                       | Sun       |
| Thrown items (Distant / Near) | D4/D6     |

## Ammunition
Ranged weapons do not track ammunition. You are assumed to carry and replenish enough arrows, bolts and bullets for your weapons automatically.

## Defenseless target
If you attack a defenseless or unaware target you have adv (as per the Hidden Status).

## Type advantage
If you are fighting magical monsters, your attacks might be weak or strong against certain types of enemies granting you adv or dis. Fire elementals are weak to water and cold, for example.

## Target size (Ranged)
If your target is Small or Tiny you attack with dis.  

## Cover (Ranged)
Physical cover or an ally in the way covering at least half of your target imposes dis on your attack.

## Height difference (Ranged)
Attacking from a position where your entire body is elevated above your target you gain adv. Attacking from a position where your entire body is elevated below your target you have dis. This is only applicable in ranges other than Touch.

## Range (ranged)
At ranges further than Nearby you have dis in Ranged Combat Attacks.  At Touch range you have dis, because it’s hard to draw a bead on an opponent that close. 
You don’t get range penalty if you fire at a defenseless or unaware target due to  the Hidden Status granting adv.

## Visibility (Ranged)
If you or your target is Obscured you have dis (as per the Obscured Status). This includes firing to Darkness and only applies to ranges other than Touch.

## Siege weapons
Using a large mounted ranged weapon such as a ballista, cannon or trebuchet takes two Actions. One to load and one to fire. However, when fired the weapon rolls twice the amount of dice its smaller counterpart would. 
Melee based siege weapons, such as a battering rams, also roll double the dice but do not need reloading. Instead, they need two simultaneous Actions to use.

## Blocking
When an enemy attacks you, they will deal damage. You must roll Block to defend and reduce the damage by every Success rolled.

### Close Combat
You roll the dice from Melee and Defense.

### Ranged Combat
You roll the dice from Ranged and Defense.

### Rune Attacks
You roll dice from Magic and Defense.

> Monsters: The following table converts Ranged Combat Factors for PCs rolling Blocks.

### Friendly Fire
When a PC is subject to an attack by another PC, it is expected that this is an intentional outcome of the team working together. The attacking PC rolls for the Attack and the target rolls Block to counter that damage.

## Recovery

### End of Combat Time
You regain your Stamina after 1 minute outside of Combat Time has passed.

### Potions of healing
If you drink a potion of healing you will regain all of your Hearts after 10 minutes has passed or the Scene ends.

### Rest
Rest takes 8 hours of light activity or sleep. During a Rest you regain all of your Hearts and gain Boons up to the number of Flaws you have.
You can only Rest once per day.

## Special Attacks
Instead of dealing damage, any character can attempt the following:

### Condition
Any Close Combat or Ranged Combat Attack can attempt to inflict a Condition on first Success similar to Rune Attacks as long as the effect is narratively justified.

### Grapple
Instead of damage, your unarmed Close Combat Attack grapples your target. Both you and your opponent are Tethered until the grapple ends.
The grappler can use the grappled as a  thrown weapon up to Close using Melee and D6 dealing 1 damage to them on Success and normal weapon damage to any target hit.
The grappled can attempt to escape by dealing at least 1 damage to the grappler with a Close Combat Attack on their turn. The damage of the attack is ignored.

## Environment
The following are phenomena that can happen naturally to PCs without an explicit attacker. 

### Falling
Falling a distance more than Close deals 1 damage + 1 damage at Nearby and +1 damage every Nearby you fall thereafter. This damage cannot be Blocked and does not count as an attack, although the GM can allow players to roll an appropriate Test to reduce the damage if the situation calls for it.

### Being Crushed
A falling object counts as a Close Combat attack and is defended against using Melee. The damage for Item is 1 and increases by 1 for every size class. Objects that fall a large distance or travel at high velocity deal an extra point of damage.
