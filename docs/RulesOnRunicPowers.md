## Interpreting
Runic Powers come with Labels that help GMs and players interpret the use of these Powers but they are not strictly beholden to these Labels. Labels are suggestions and should be ignored if the situation calls for it.

### Interpret as Cast
Interpret an effect as Cast if 
-  The effect of the Power is simple and potentially destructive in nature. 
-  The size or  shape of an effect is unclear
-  It is a Rune Attack
Non-offensive Casts do not need to roll any dice.

### Interpret as Test
Interpret an effect as Rune Test if
-  The effect is complex in nature
-  The effect does not need an exact size or shape
-  The Power is non-offensive and the outcome is uncertain

### Interpret as Both
If a Runic Power has both Cast and Test labels it is recommended to limit the effects of a Test within one shape allowed by Cast.

### Interpreting as Neither
Certain Runic Powers can be activated without any specifications. The effect happens with no rolls needed, such as turning invisible via Invisibility.

### Casts
Delivery: When using Cast Rules, effects are fit within a limited number of shapes allowed by the rules called Deliveries. Deliveries are described in the Combat section. 
Attacking: If used offensively, Runic Powers interpreted as Casts are must also be interpreted as Rune Attacks. See Rune Attacks (page ) on how to interpret the result of a Cast as an attack.

### Tests
Forced Tests: Some Runic Powers are specific on how  the result of the Rune Test affects the outcome. These usually describe the size of a target the effect can affect. Some powers require a Test to bring uncertainty. These powers rely on information or power beyond the PCs’ control and thus can just fail. This also prevents abusing these powers.

### Open Tests
Many Runic Powers have the Test-label but only offer suggestions on what the Test can mean. These powers ask the GM to determine if an attempted action is difficult enough to warrant a Test and also declare if an action is too large to attempt at all.

## Focus
Certain powers say sustaining them requires you to Focus. You can only Focus on one effect at a time, you can stop Focusing at will ending the effect and if you begin Focusing on a new effect the old one disappears. If you die you stop Focusing. You may cast Focus Powers without Focusing but the effect must begin and end within one Turn.

### When to Focus
Focus is a flexible mechanic. Many effects explicitly require Focus and others don’t. It is up to the GM to determine when Focus should be demanded. As a general guideline, magical effects that linger and are not self sustaining need Focusing.

## Limitations

### Overriding free will
Runic Powers cannot override the free will of sentient creatures. No Runic Power can physically or mentally force another creature to do or be something against their will. Similarly, you cannot transform your enemies into pigeons or gold without their consent. Any effect that would inflict such result can be resisted in which case the the target either takes damage or a harmful condition detailed in the Combat rules.

### Repeated use
Just as people cannot run full speed indefinitely or lift heavy weights around the clock, Runic Powers take endurance and thus cannot be used in repeated succession. It is up to the table to determine if constant usage of a Runic Power is reasonable.

### Scene is the limit
Generally, Runic Powers should be used once during a short Scene and their effects end when the Scene changes. This includes Focusing on them.

### Complexity of results
Runic Powers allow PCs to do something that bends the rules of physics. They do not, however, gain supernatural skill with that power. The GM can ask the player if they have a related Tag that could grant them the necessary skill for such task.

> A potter with the Rune of Earth probably has a Skill Tag of Pottery, which they can use if they want to use their magical control of clay to form intricate pots. Otherwise they would only be able to create basic shapes.

## Summons

A number of Runic Powers creates a Summon. This section details the rules on Summons.

### Stats
The Summon uses your Signs and Scores. It has your speed. Summons have 1 Heart.

### Actions
You and your Summon can move independently an simultaneously. Only one of you can take an Action each  Turn but you can add additional Actions by spending 1 Stamina per Action. You and each Summon can only take 1 Action per Turn. You and your Summons share Stamina. Summons cannot Focus.

### Dismissing
You may dismiss the Summon at will, effectively killing it.

### Powers
Summons only have access to powers described in the feature that created it.

### Limitations
You can only have one Summon active at a time. Summons cannot create additional Summons.

## Spells
Runic Powers are magical powers granted by your Rune but they are not spells. A Spell is a complicated ritual that requires knowledge and preparation. 

### Requirements
PCs can gain access to a Spell and the necessary components and Sigils to cast it but do not have them by default. The GM determines how difficult such components and knowledge are to find and if any limitations to the casting need to be accounted for. Spells are a tool for the GM to allow for powerful magic to exist in the world.
Casting time: Spells require complicated rituals to cast. In general a Spell takes at least a Scene to cast and the required time grows with the power of the spell.

### GM Choice
Spells are entirely within the choice of the GM to allow or disallow. PCs do not have access to powerful Spells unless the GM explicitly grants them that knowledge.  The GM also fully determines the effects of these Spells.
