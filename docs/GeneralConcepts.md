## Actions 

On your Turn you can perform one Action. Actions refresh at the start of you Turn.

### Action order

Creatures of  the same team can do their actions in any order and even intertwine their Actions or Movement as they best see fit. If a creature has First Strike they must take the first Action.

## Freebies

These things usually take very little time and are often not the main point of your Turn. Freebies can be done for free during your Turn without spending an Action and there is no limit how many Freebies you can do, though many Freebies limit themselves to once per Turn.

### Stealth

If, for any reason, you would stop being Hidden, you may attempt a Skill Test. On a Success you remain Hidden provided you are able to end your Turn Hidden. If not, you will be discovered at the end of your Turn.

### Use

You may interact with one object that is not a weapon during your Turn. Kicking down a table to provide cover or pulling a lever to open a secret exit.

## Health

All PCs have 3 Hearts. Taking a point of damage reduces Hearts by 1. At 0 Hearts you are Vulnerable and can die. See Vulnerable (p.32).

## Stamina

You have 3 points of Stamina you can use to empower your Actions. If you need to spend more Stamina but canâ€™t you may take 1 point of damage per Stamina spent.
You may spend 1 Stamina to:
- Reroll an Attack: You may reroll one die on a Close Combat or Ranged Combat attack roll. By default you cannot reroll Rune Attacks.
- Reroll Block: You may reroll one die on a Block roll.
- Big Casts: Certain Rune Attacks require Stamina and affect large areas.
- End a Condition: Roll your Defense die and end a Condition on Success.
- +1 Step: Your base speed for that Turn is increased by 1 Step.

### Regaining Stamina

Certain Actions you take regain Stamina. All Stamina is regained after 1 minute outside of Combat Time has passed.
