# Statuses

Statuses work similar to Conditions.  Statuses cannot be Blocked, cannot be directly caused by Attacks and last indefinitely or until ended. 

## Asleep
You are unconscious and Prone. You are unable to take Actions or move. The condition ends if you take damage or another creature spends and Action to wake you up by touching you. Most creatures naturally wake up after 8 hours of rest.

## Hidden
You are Hidden from a creature if they are unaware or unable to be aware of your position. You Attack them with adv.
Creatures can become aware of your position for example through sight, hearing or smell.
Monsters: PCs Block Hidden monsters with dis.

## Obscured
An obscured creature is concealed by some kind of environmental effect such as steam or Darkness. Full physical cover does not count as obscured. 
Ranged Combat Attacks against and made by creatures that are Obscured roll with dis. An Obscured creature attacking another Obscured creature attacks with dis but does not double it.
Monsters: PCs Block Obscured monsters with adv and Obscured PCs Block with adv. Both being Obscured does not double it.

## Vulnerable
A creatures becomes Vulnerable when they are at 0 Hearts. If a Vulnerable creature takes any damage they die, unless a healing potion is administered or they are healed by other means before the end of their next Turn. Attacking a Vulnerable creature does not need a roll and automatically succeeds.
Monsters: Vulnerable PCs cannot Block.
