## Rewards

The GM can use the following guidelines to create magical artifacts as rewards or plot points.

### Adventuring Items

Consumable items are the main intended reward for Runecycle. They are relatively weak in power and donâ€™t linger in the game creating problems. A consumable item is comparable to 2 XP in a level-up.

### Runestone artifacts

A magical item that grants full access to a new Runic Power is comparable to four level-ups.
Once per day: If an item grants access to a Runic Power once per day, it is comparable to two level-ups.
Traits: Traits are worth approximately two level-ups.
Trait-enhancing: An item that turns a Trait into a Runic Power is also worth two level-ups.
Trait 1/day: An item that grants a Trait once per day is comparable to one level-up.

#### 1/day
Items that work once per day generally grant their benefits for one Scene. These items act as capacitors storing magical energy slowly over time until releasing it when activated.

### Spells

An item that creates the effects of a Spell once per day can vary in its value. If the casting time of the Spell would be less than 5 minutes it is comparable to two level-ups. If 5-9 it is comparable to four level-ups.

### The +1 sword

Runecycle does not have modifiers, so the traditional +1 weapon is not something that can be easily done. However, weapons that increase the Melee die or armor that increases the Defense die by one size are entirely viable. This is comparable to a PC leveling up four times. Do consider, however, that the maximum die possible is a D12 so giving such item to a player who is already intending to gain the D12 on a level up is not recommended.
