Conditions are effects that affect creatures temporarily. By default each condition lasts 1 minute or until the narrative justifies it ending. Conditions of the same type cannot stack.

## Afraid
You cannot move within Close to the source of your fear.

## Confused
At the start of your turn roll D12. On a fail you lose your Action for that turn.

## Damage Over Time
Damage Over Time (DOT) is an effect that continues to hurt you. Burning, poisoned, bleeding among others. Different sources of DOT can affect the same creature simultaneously and not count as stacks of the same effect.
At the start of your turn roll D12. On a fail you take 1 damage.

## Disarmed
You drop whatever you are holding and the condition ends. Items dropped this way can be flung up to Close as chosen by the attacker. Magical disarming can instead prevent the target from using Rune Attacks until the casters next turn.

## Flung
You are flung in a direction  chosen by the caster a distance up to Close, usually directly away from the caster. Ends after you hit the ground.

## Hindered
You roll all rolls until the end of your next Turn with dis. 
Monsters: Attacks against them and Blocks against their attacks have adv.

## Prone
You are on the ground and you are Slowed. You may stand up by spending a Step ending the condition.  If you are prone, your Close Combat Attacks have dis. Close Combat Attacks against a prone target have adv. Being Prone reduces your Size by 1.
Monsters:  Prone PCs Block monsters with dis. PCs Block Prone monsters with adv.

## Sleepy
At the start of your turn roll D12. On a fail the condition ends and you fall Asleep.

## Slowed
You treat all terrain as Difficult Terrain.

## Tethered
You and a target are stuck to each other. If you try to move while the other is resisting, you are Slowed for that Turn and pull them with you. Being Tethered to a heavy and solid object lets you move as far as the tethering medium allows. 
Monsters: can end this condition as an Action without rolling.
