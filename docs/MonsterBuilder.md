> This list contains examples but you are encouraged to use it as a baseline and come up with your own features.

## Boss Monsters

Monster that are large enough to fight the entire party should not be fought but sometimes PCs might do so. These monsters, and some other enemies have what is called Guard.

### Guard vs Group Test

If an enemy has Guard, this means they are immune to damage until their Guard is brought down. Any Attacks and Tests made during your groups turn to lower Guard are considered Successes in a Group Test. When the number of Successes exceeds the enemy’s guard value, excess Successes count as normal for Attacks. This Test must be completed during your Groups turn. Guard is regained at the end of the Monster’s Turn.

### Last Strike problem

Generally, there should be at least one attack in the Test to deal damage. Narratively it may feel odd if the last Success is not an attack, so the GM should narrate the whole Test in a way that make narrative sense, possibly reordering the actions the players take.

### Hearts

A good baseline value for Boss Monsters is 6 Hearts and 2 Guard when fighting a four PC party.

### Attacks

Four Threat Level 1 enemies are assumed to deal approximately 10 attacks in an encounter. Boss monsters should deal about the same amount of attacks over an encounter against a four PC party.

Multiattack: to get to the appropriate amount of damage for a Boss Monster, consider having the Boss attack two different targets or have an area attack that can hit multiple enemies at once.

Lair actions: The environment can also act as part of the Boss and “attack” the party to increase attacks per round.
