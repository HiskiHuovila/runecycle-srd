# Time & Space

You will spend a large amount of time interacting with the world freely. Generally, unless interrupted by Combat Time, you will explore the world in Free Time.

## Scenes
Free Time can loosely be divided into Scenes. These are periods of time during which PCs have a certain location they explore or interact with. A scene can be an intense investigation of a room, a brief walk through a forest or a fair period of downtime in a city. The GM determines what constitutes as a Scene and moves between them. While actively adventuring and a precise measurement is needed, a Scene is 10 minutes.

> When every PC has had their turn to do something in a scene the GM can transition to the next scene. It is good practice to ask the table “Do you wish to continue to x?” and if no-one disagrees you can move the story forward.

## Theater of the Mind
The most common way to explore the world in Free Time is without any maps or aids. The GM narrates what  the players see and the players are free to tell the GM what they wish to do. 

> The players are encouraged to ask questions about their surroundings. Problem solving is about coming up with ideas and not about rolling dice.

## Maps
Some locations benefit from visual aids. Naturally during combat but also in some other circumstances a discrete map is recommended.

> A recommended size for human scale combat is on a 1-inch grid with an inch representing 5 feet or about 2 meters. This is also the distance of Touch.

## Travel
Large scale travel through a forest or trek around the countryside benefits from a discrete map. For travel a map with a hexagonal grid or discrete paths between points of interest is recommended.

> A good scale for a hex map is 6 miles per hex or between points. PCs travel approximately one mile of wilderness in an hour, converting to one hex per day.
