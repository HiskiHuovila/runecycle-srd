# Introduction

When situations call for rapid reflexes and precise teamwork the GM can set the game to Combat Time. Combat Time usually begins when weapons get drawn.

## Combat Time
When the game is set to Combat Time play is restricted to Rounds. A Round represents about 6 seconds in the game world, during which each team in the encounter takes a Turn. The phrase ‘your Turn’ refers to the Turn of the whole team.

### Turn Order
Usually there are two sides in a combat. If there are more than two sides, determine the order of remaining sides randomly.

## First Strike
The first creature to attack can force the start of Combat Time. This is called First Strike. Their side begins combat with that creature taking the first action: the Action used to attack.

> Unless PCs are ready for confrontation, enemies are assumed to get First Strike. In rare occasions both  sides surprise each other, in which case  a Group Test determines if PCs get First Strike.
