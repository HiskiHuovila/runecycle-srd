## Creature Size
Creatures are divided into 6 size categories. Whenever the rules refer to creature size and say larger / smaller by one size the assumed size class moves down / up this list by one.

### Tiny 
Up to the size of a human baby.

### Small 
Up to the size of a human child.

### Medium
Up to the size of an adult human.

### Large
Up to the size of an adult bear, cow or horse.

### Huge
Up to the size of an adult elephant or dinosaur.

### Gargantuan
Larger than any other size class. Examples include blue whales, adult krakens and adult dragons.


> Most PCs are Medium sized. Some can also be Small but usually not  smaller. PCs (while not affected by magic) should be Large in only exceptional circumstances and never Huge or larger.

## Item Size
The weight of items is divided into four classifications. S/W or Size is used as shorthand for Size and Weight. Whenever the rules refer to item size and say larger / smaller by one size the assumed size class moves down / up this list by one.

### Item
Weighs up to the amount you reasonably can carry using both hands and takes up the same amount of space.

### Object
Either the size of Small creature of heavy material such as stone or Medium sized creature size of light material such as wood.

### Structure 
Takes up to a Huge area worth of light material such as wood or a Medium sized area of heavy material such as stone.

### Building
Weighs more or equal to an area of Huge worth of heavy material such as stone.

> PCs are assumed to be  strong enough to lift one Object or  carry around an Item with both hands. In terms of creatures this means carrying Small creatures and lifting Medium ones.
