## Spells

If the GM wishes to reward the PCs with the knowledge of a powerful Spell or use Spells as a plot device, the following can be used to estimate the power level of  a Spell effect.
A Spell consists of the following elements:
-  Spell effect
-  Area / number of targets
-  Duration

### Effect

Common (1): Any effect of a Runic Power.  
Rare (5): An effect that is outside of the limitations of Runic Powers but generally achievable by any talented wizard.  
Exceptional (10): An effect so powerful that it is only available to a select few, or requires and advanced civilization to research but overall limited in its effect.  
World altering (25): An effect so powerful its creation is a once in a century occurrence taking massive preparation.

### Area

Single Target (1): Spell affects one target who / that participates in the casting.  
Close (2): Spell can affect targets / area within Close.  
Distant (3): Spell can affect targets / area within Distant.  
Far away (5): Spell can affect targets  / area within a distance limited by the GM or a single target anywhere in the world.

### Duration

If a Spell has a lingering effect, the following duration modifiers apply:  
Scene (1):  The effect lasts for 10 minutes.  
Hour (2): The effect lasts for an hour.  
Day (5): The effect lasts for a day.  
Permanent (x): Varies based on the Effect. Common 10, Rare 15, Exceptional 20 and World Altering 50.

### Casting Time

To estimate the rarity and casting time of a Spell, calculate the values for Effect, Area and Duration and multiply the values together.
The outputted value is the time the Spell takes to cast in minutes.

| **Time** | **rarity**                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| < 5      | can be given to players safely        |
| 5-9      | rare, can be given as reward          |
| 10-24    | reserved for villains and big rewards |
| 25-99    | campaign defining plot device         |
| 100+     | history changing event                |

### GM  fiat

This system is very limited in its power estimation and is heavily influenced by GM interpretation. It should be used as a tool to ballpark effects and not as a strict rule how the game should be played.
