## Monster Rules

### Enemy Tactics

Monsters  will move a number of steps equal to their speed and Attack using one their weapons each turn.If a Monster is unable to Attack anything, it will spend its Action to move an additional Step. 

### Dice

Generally, Monsters do not need to roll anything. If such situation would ever occur, roll D8 and D10.

### Attacks

When an Monster attacks a PC, the player will roll Block. Monsters denote the number of damage their attacks deal next to the attack. Every Success rolled for Block reduces that damage by 1. Attacks follow the rules of Close Combat, Ranged Combat and Rune Attacks respectively but instead of rolling to attack, PCs must roll to Block their attacks.

### Improvise

You should not feel the need to adhere perfectly to the given monster attacks. Players are allowed to improvise attacks and so should the GM. Just because a statblock says the monster only has Close Combat capability does not mean it cannot wield ranged weapons. Use this option sparingly, as monsters that can attack at all ranges reduce the amount of strategy players can have.

### Difficult Terrain

Monsters will avoid Difficult Terrain if possible.Otherwise they will follow normal Difficult Terrain rules.

### Targeting

Monsters usually target the closest enemy. If a monster has to choose between enemies it will prioritize enemies that have attacked it before.

### Adv. and Dis.

If the game rules grant adv or impose dis on an attack made by a monster, the player Blocking that attack instead has dis or adv respectively. Similarly, if a monster has adv or dis on a Block roll, the attacking player has dis or adv respectively on their attack. Most rules have a Monsters section that has pre-converted this rule for you.

### Stamina

Monsters do not have Stamina but can still use Rune Attacks that cost Stamina.

### Vulnerable Enemies

Monsters have different reactions to being Vulnerable. The most violent will always fight to the death but those with some amount of intelligence will often try to escape and hide.

### Intelligent enemies

Humanoids tend to carry weapons or other equipment to augment their limited combat ability.  They usually have both Close Combat and Ranged Combat weapons and sometimes Adventuring Items. When defeated, these weapons and items can be stolen from them by the PCs.
