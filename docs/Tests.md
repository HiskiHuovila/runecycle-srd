## How to Roll

Grab two dice – one for your Exploration Scores (Skill, Think, Social or Rune)  used in the Test and another for the Tag that you and your GM deem helpful for the Test (the die of the Sign the Tag belongs to).  If no Tags are helpful, take a D4. Then roll your two dice together.

### Success

A roll of 6 or higher on a die is called a Success. A roll of 10 or higher on a single die (only possible with a D10 or D12) counts as two Successes. You cannot roll Successes on a D4. You can choose to downgrade or fail a Test.

### Two or more Successes

Yes, and. If you roll two or more Successes, you reach your stated goal without issue and might also gain some additional bonus effect, such as extra damage.

### Only one attempt

You only have one chance to succeed with any action (including Runic Powers). Once you have rolled the dice, and rerolled if able, you may not roll again to attempt the same goal in the same scenario.

## Test Types

### Rules Test

A Rules Test is a Test that is specifically determined in the rules and has pre-set success and fail outcomes.

### Called Test

This is a Test the GM asks a player to make. In a Called Test  the player makes a wager: what will they gain on Success and what will be the penalty for failure, and the GM and other players negotiate an appropriate offer. Rolling multiple Successes allows players to request additional benefits.

> Generally, each Test should be only attempted once per Scene. The result of the roll applies to the whole Scene.

## Modifiers

External factors can modify your roll as determined by the GM. Each source of aid or hinderance imposes one Advantage or Disadvantage on your roll.

### Advantage (ADV)

When you have adv, you may reroll one die.

### Disadvantage (DIS)

When you have dis, you must remove any one die. This means you’ll be rolling just one die instead of two.

### Cumulative

If you have several adv or dis, one adv cancels out one dis.

#### Excess Advantages

If you have more than one adv you may reroll each die once.

#### Excess Disadvantages

If you have more than one dis, your remaining die becomes a D6.

## Group Tests

Sometimes the situation calls for an entire group to work together. In these situations every member of the group must make a Test and the group succeeds if the total number of Successes equals or exceeds the number of participants. You cannot Help each other while performing a group Test.

## Attack rolls

Attack rolls are specified in the Combat section. They generally follow the same procedure as Tests but are not considered Tests by the rules. For example, you can attempt to hit the same target multiple times.

## Help from others

One person can help you on a Test, granting you adv. This must be declared before you roll, they must be physically able to help you and they must have a Tag that would be helpful in the situation. The GM has final say.

## Boons

The GM can grant PCs Boons. These are single use adv you store and can choose to apply to your Test later. Only one Boon can be used per Test. Boons generally don’t expire and can be used whenever appropriate but the GM can set a time limit for the Boon to expire or special conditions when a specific Boon can be used. Boons without conditions can be used retroactively to reroll one die on a Test after you know the result.
Boons can be gained, for example, from the following:
-  Doing research
-  Practicing or maintenance
-  Bonding activities
-  Planning

## Banes

The GM can impose PCs Banes. These are single effect dis that you gain and are forced to apply on your next Test. GM can set a time limit for a Bane to expire or special conditions when a specific Bane triggers.
Banes can be gained, for example, from the following:
-  As consequenc for failing a Test
-  Extreme weather conditions
-  Going without sleep
-  Being ill or poisoned

> Boons and Banes  only apply to Tests but the GM can set a specific Boon or Bane to affect other rolls as well.
