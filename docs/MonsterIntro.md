Adventures are nothing without conflict. This section details how you can design engaging creatures to encounter and fight.

### Difficulty

When pre-planning or improvising a combat encounter, a good and challenging but manageable and likely not lethal encounter is of Threat Level equal to the number of PCs. This means the enemy side is able to take and deal about the same amount of damage as the player side.

### On lethality

Runecycle will keep players on edge. Any encounter as described above will see players at 1 or 0 Hearts. As such, only a few combat encounters are needed per game session.

### Threat Level

Threat Level assumes players kill monsters one by one. A Threat Level 2 monster has twice the surviving time, effectively doubling the time it has to deal damage. If  players are fighting only Treat Level 2 enemies, the encounter will be more deadly than a fight of equal Threat Level consisting only of TL 1 enemies. To counteract this, consider instead having only one TL 2 Monster and the remaining Monsters be TL 1.

### Nonviolent encounters

Threat Level only works on combat encounters. Consider leaving possibility of nonviolent resolution and allow players to cleverly weaken enemies or avoid fighting completely.
