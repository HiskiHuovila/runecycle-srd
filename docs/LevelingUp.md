## Leveling Up

The things you learn during the game are measured in Experience Points (XP). You receive XP after the end of each game session. Talk among the table and determine what you achieved. For each of the below questions that you can reply “yes” to, you get one XP:
-  Did you participate in the game?
-  Did you explore a new location?
-  Did you defeat one or more dangerous adversaries?
-  Did you overcome an obstacle without using force?
-  Did you act like your Aspect?
-  Did you perform another extraordinary action of some kind?
You can use your XP to improve your skills or gain new powers. You can only spend XP when your PC gets a chance to rest, or between game sessions.

### Milestone leveling
Your GM might want to change how fast you level up or otherwise demand more narrative integrity from leveling up. In this instance the GM can deal out XP whenever they deem appropriate.

### XP Debt
If the narrative demands it, the GM can allow or impose XP debt on you. You gain your new change and pay off the debt later.  Taking more should not be allowed if you already have XP debt.

### Signs and scores
To increase a Sign or Score level by one step costs a number of XP indicated on the table. You can only increase a Sign or Score one step each session.

### Tags
You may replace Tags and gain new one’s by spending XP as indicated on the table

### Flaws
You may replace one flaw with another by spending XP as indicated on the table.

### New Runic Powers
You can gain more Runic Powers by spending XP as indicated on the table.
If a Trait is part of a Runic Power or you have a Trait-Cast you can upgrade the Trait into a full power.
